## Introduction to Database Management Systems

### Definitions

- `Data: ` Data is a collection of facts, typically the results of some experiments or observations.
- `Information: ` Information is the result of processing, manipulating and organizing data in a way that adds to the knowledge of the person receiving it.
- `Database: ` A database is a collection of related data.
- `Metadata: ` Metadata is data about data. It is the data describing the properties of the data.
- `Database Management System (DBMS): ` A DBMS is a software that handles the storage, retrieval, and updating of data in a computer system.

### Properties of Database

- A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini-world or the universe of discourse (UoD).

- A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.

- A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.

### Database Users

- `Database Administrators: ` Database administrators are responsible for authorizing access to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, and acquiring software and hardware resources as needed.

- `Database Designers: ` Database designers are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data.

- `End Users: ` End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating reports; they are the majority of users of the system.

- `System Analysts and Application Programmers: ` System analysts and programmers are responsible for studying the problems of the existing system and designing the new system to meet user requirements. They are also responsible for the development of application programs that will run on top of the database, along with the specifications for any additional software that is needed.

- `System Designers & Implementers: ` System designers and implementers are responsible for implementing the database on the computer.

- `Tool Developers: ` Tool developers are people who develop specialized database systems such as database management systems, database utilities, and database language compilers.

- `Operator & Maintenance Personnel: ` Operator and maintenance personnel are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the database system.

### Advantages of DBMS

- Controlling Redundancy : Redundancy is the concept of repetition of data i.e. storing the same data multiple times. This is avoided in DBMS.

- Restricting Unauthorized Access : Unauthorized access is restricted by means of passwords and other security measures.

- Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects : Program objects are stored in the database and are available for future use.

- Providing Storage Structures for Efficient Query Processing : The database system provides a run-time database machine that handles incoming requests for data.

- Providing Backup and Recovery : The database system provides facilities for recovering hardware and software failures.

- Providing Multiple User Interfaces : The database system provides different views of the database to different classes of users.

- Representing Complex Relationships among Data : The database system allows the data to be represented in a variety of ways.

- Enforcing Integrity Constraints : The database system provides facilities for defining integrity constraints on the database.

- Permitting Inferencing and Actions Using Rules : The database system provides facilities for defining deduction rules and for defining actions that should take place automatically when some event occurs.

- Additional Implications of Using a DBMS : The database system provides facilities for defining security and integrity constraints on the data, and for recovering the database should it become damaged.
