### What is Scrum ?

- Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

### Scrum vs Agile
- Agile is a set of values and principles about how to produce i.e. develop software.
- Scrum is a framework to implement Agile development.

### Scrum Roles and Responsibilities

- `Product Owner` is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
- `Scrum Master` is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.
- `Development Team` is responsible for delivering potentially releasable `Done` product increments at the end of each Sprint. A `Done` increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

### Everything You Need to Know About Scrum Artifacts

- `Product Backlog` is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
- `Sprint Backlog` is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
- `Increment` is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

### Scrum Fondations

- `Sprint` is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
- `Sprint Planning` is a time-boxed event that occurs at the beginning of each Sprint. The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
- `Daily Scrum` is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
- `Sprint Review` is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.
- `Sprint Retrospective` is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

### The Daily Scrum

- The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
- The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work.
- The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal. Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based.

### Scrum Essentials

- Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.
- Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.
- Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.

### Sprint Planning

- The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
- Sprint Planning answers the following:
  - What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
  - How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

### Scrum Sprint Review

- The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

### Scrum Sprint Retrospective

- The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

### How To Create A Product Backlog

- The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

### 5 Common User Story Writing Mistakes
- Stories Are Not Small Enough
- Stories Are Not Independent
- Stories Are Too Technical
- Stories Are Not Testable
- Stories Are Not Negotiable
