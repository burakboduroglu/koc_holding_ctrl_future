## Five Levels of Professional Mark

1.  Household Hero

    - At this point you just started building your professional mark. Only your close contacts (colleagues, clients, and members of your group) know and respect your expertise because you told them. You have probably provided solutions to some of their problems and answered some of their questions. You are recognizable online too but not too many people have found you yet. Focus on improving your online presence and your body of work

2.  Resident Hero

    - People outside your immediate circle are beginning to feel your impact and appreciate your work. This is the start of thought leadership for you—creating tweets, stories, and social media posts. You’re more active in your local business communities, often speaking at business functions and blogging. Your focus at this point should be building up your credibility and growing your audience by creating and promoting quality content.

3.  Emerging Hero

    - You have developed a level of reputation in your industry and are known in other industries as well. You frequently speak and write on your area of expertise and you are emerging as a leader. People want to hear your opinion on issues and you now get invites to speak at key events and facilitate trainings. Referrals are becoming normal; you attract higher fees for your services and people are willing to pay for your time. Aim to create some proprietary materials like a book, or a signature talk.

4.  Industry Hero

        - You are known in your niche nationally and are among the top in your industry. Premium clients request for your service and you’re more of an asset to businesses. Requests for partnerships come in more often you constantly get invitations to speak or feature in an event. This draws more audience who are interested to hear you. You have grown your own community and have materials that are often referenced by people. You are also very visible on the internet. Your focus should be to keep refining your technique, your structure, and growing your community.

5.  Global Hero

    - You have influence globally and are among the elite experts in the globe. Organizations and individuals work to associate with you. Your network keeps growing without your direct input. People across the globe go out of their ways to connect with you. Celebrities and influential people recommend you and your services. Your work is trusted because of your years of expertise
