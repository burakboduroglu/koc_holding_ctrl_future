### What is Agile ?

- Agile is a project management methodology that uses short development cycles called “sprints” to focus on continuous improvement in the development of a product or service.

- `Principles of Agile: `

  - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
  - Most important thing is satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
  - The software should be delivered frequently, in a time span of few weeks to few months.
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
  - In a software team, the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is quality conversation.
  - Agile methods promote sustainable development.
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
  - Simplicity is essential.
  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
  - The project team should be well motivated.
  - The team thinks about how to become more effective, and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
  - The change in requirements is welcomed, even late in development.

- `Aim of Agile: `

  - Self organizing, cross functional teams.
  - Deliver working software frequently.
  - Increase project output speed.
  - To increase the project team's adaptation to change.
  - Open to continuous learning and change.

### Agile Project Management - Sprints

- `Sprint: `

  - A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
  - Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.

- `Sprint Planning: `

  - Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.
  - The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.

- `Sprint Review: `

  - The sprint review is an informal meeting that takes place at the end of each sprint where the team presents the work that was completed during the sprint.
  - During the sprint review, the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the sprint planning meeting.

- `Sprint Retrospective: `

  - The sprint retrospective is a meeting facilitated by the scrum master at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive.
  - The sprint retrospective is the final step in the sprint.

### - How to create an Agile Product Vision?

- `Product Vision: `

  - A product vision is a shared understanding of the product you are trying to build.

  - A product vision should answer two questions: "Why are we building this product?" and "What value will it bring to our users and our business?"

- `Product Mission: `

  - A product mission is a short statement that describes why your product exists.
  - It should be a clear, concise statement that explains the purpose of your product.
  - A product mission should answer the question: "Why are we building this product?"

- `Product Strategy: `

  - A product strategy is a plan for how you will achieve your product vision.
  - It is a high-level plan that describes how you will achieve your product vision.

- `Product Backlog: `

  - A product backlog is a list of all the work that needs to be done to achieve your product vision.
  - It is a list of all the work that needs to be done to achieve your product vision.

### What Is A Product Roadmap?

- `Product Roadmap: `
  - A product roadmap is a high-level plan that describes how you will achieve your product vision.
